    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     Currently seeking to grow as an individual through any and all means 
     available. I am privileged enough to have attended Pretoria University
     in the field of Information Technology. I hope someday to use this
     privilege in a field wherein I can both show innovation and create
     value in the work I produce. As an individual, I pride myself on living
     with passion and zest, an attitude I carry through into the work
     environment. I am in equal parts ambitious, enthusiastic with a keen
     mind for learning, problem solving, abstract reasoning and selfimprovement.

experiences:
    - role: Leader of Team Sigma (Capstone Project)
      time: 08/05/2020 – 18/10/2020
      company: EPI-USE Labs
      details: |
       During my final year at varsity, I was fortunate enough to work in a fine group of 6 hardworking students. About a 
       month into the project our former leader got diagnosed with Osteosarcoma and was forced to discontinue the module.
       With the support of my team I was selected to lead our team towards our end goal. Our Clients at EPI-USE Labs tasked
       us (Team Sigma) with designing a Home Security System called Argus. Argus is a multi-platform web application capable
       of instantly identifying threats on multiple camera feeds around a one's home whilst also notifying them in real time
       either via Email or SMS of any potential threats picked up by the system. Being leader taught me a lot about team
       management and organization, acknowledging where your team members interest and strengths/skills may reside is
       also imperative as it allows for tasks when assigned to be delivered on time. Listening and constant communication was
       another skill I thought to be crucial to the project’s success as lockdown due to COVID-19 was happening meaning all
       forms of communication and strategizing had to occurred online. By using an Agile methodology with daily stand-ups
       and biweekly sprints we were able to keep ahead of schedule.
    - role: Tutor
      time: 03/02/2020 – 03/07/2020
      company: University of Pretoria
      details: |
       As a Tutor I was tasked with marking, setting up practical assignments, consultations and giving 2-hours lectures every
       week. Tutoring gave me a lot of confidence when it came to public speaking especially in front of large groups of
       people. I designed my own presentations and was always open to criticism as anything I could do to improve would
       only benefit the students that I was so eager to teach.
    - role: Waitron
      time: 01/12/2018 – 31/01/2019
      company: Cut & Craft Bistro
      details: |
       Working as a Waiter taught me many people skills especially when it came to dealing with customers and how to
       correctly handle conflict whilst simultaneously working towards an agreeable solution which would still meet the
       customer’s needs. Another valuable lesson I learned was how to push through and keep my head up even under
       pressure, this has also helped me during my studies with time management when it came to meeting deadlines.
